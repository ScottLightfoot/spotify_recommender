## Spotify Song Recommender

---

### -- Project Status: Active

Originally part of a group project that has since gone offline, this project is an update and expansion of that work.

---

## Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is to implement a recommendation engine that uses two datasets to suggest similar songs that are less commonly recommended. The first dataset contains a list of Spotify songs that have track features used to find the nearest comparable tracks. The second is a dataset containing user playlists.

The objective is to identify the nearest songs by features and then filter out those most often found in user playlists featuring the target song.

### Methods Used

- Nearest Neighbors
- Radar/Spider Plots
- Predictive Modeling

### Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter
- Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib, Plotly
- PostGres DB
- Spotify API
